This is a python implementation of different versions of recurrent neural networks. The main goal was to minimize lines of code used for implementation, thus making code readable and maintainable, while preserving complete functionality needed for training and testing of the models. 

Currently implemented are:

**Simple single hidden layer recurrent net.** Essentially a feedforward network, where the outputs of single hidden layer are connected to its inputs. For example usage, see example_rnn.py .
